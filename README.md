Certainly! Here's a README file for your "Typing Speed Checker" program in Tkinter:

# Typing Speed Checker

## Introduction

The "Typing Speed Checker" is a simple Python program built using the Tkinter library that allows you to test and improve your typing speed. The program displays a random text passage, and your goal is to type it as accurately and quickly as possible. After a set time, your typing speed (in words per minute, WPM) is calculated, and your score is compared to your high score.

## Features

- Randomly generated text passages for typing practice.
- Timer to track your typing speed within a specified time limit.
- Calculation of your typing speed (WPM) and comparison to your high score.
- Option to set the duration of the typing test.
- High score is saved in a file for future comparisons.
- A user-friendly GUI with a pleasant design.
